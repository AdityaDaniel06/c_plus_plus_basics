Types of data structures
Primitive ----> int , float  char , Bool
Non-primitive-----> Linear ---> Array , Stack Linklist , queue
                    Non-linear ---> Graph , Tree 

DS is an arrangement of data in computer's memory. It makes the data quicky available to the processer for the required operation.
It allows data to be stored , organized and access so that various opertions can be performed easily. 


Sorting Technique
depends on two parameters -- Time Complexity : Time taken for execution of program
                        -- Space Complexity : Space  taken taken by the  program

Sorting can be performed using several Techniques or methods-- somere
Bubble
Insertin
selection Sort
merge

Graph-- can be cylic or acylic
 Traversing  Technique in Graph: BFS and DFS
    BFS--queue  approch(level order) --LIFO
    DFS-- no node exploring
